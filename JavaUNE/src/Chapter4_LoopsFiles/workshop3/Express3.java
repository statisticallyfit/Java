/**
 * NOTE: remember that "=" sign is right-associative!
 *
 That is, suppose that  w  is 1,  x  is 2,  y  is 4, and  z  is 8. If  =  is left-associative, then when

 w = x = y = z;
 is executed, the actions will occur in this order:

 w  will be assigned the value of  x  (2);
 x  will be assigned the value of  y  (4); and
 y  will be assigned the value of  z  (8).
 so that 2, 4, 8 and 8 will appear when the variableâ€™s values are displayed.

 On the other hand, if  =  is right-associative, then when

 w = x = y = z;
 is executed, the actions will occur in this order:

 y  will be assigned the value of  z  (8);
 x  will be assigned the value of  y  (8); and
 w  will be assigned the value of  x  (8).
 so that 8, 8, 8 and 8 will be displayed.
