The silvery moonlight danced and beamed through the rustling fig tree leaves.
Their wide, heart-shaped leaves caught the moonbeams and seemed to play with them,
splashing them around like dewdrops over their generous surface. Stars glimmered high above,
and shadows cast about like playful foxes in a game of chase. The night air was cool
and dry and lily of the valley flowers scented the air with their sweet perfume.
Nightingales had long ago sung their last song before the last rays of sun
bathed the scene in vibrant red, and now the world was asleep, the soft grays, purples,
and faded blues of night was its only blanket.
