1: The silvery moonlight danced and beamed through the rustling fig tree leaves.
2: Their wide, heart-shaped leaves caught the moonbeams and seemed to play with them,
3: splashing them around like dewdrops over their generous surface. Stars glimmered high above,
4: and shadows cast about like playful foxes in a game of chase. The night air was cool
5: and dry and lily of the valley flowers scented the air with their sweet perfume.
6: Nightingales had long ago sung their last song before the last rays of sun
7: bathed the scene in vibrant red, and now the world was asleep, the soft grays, purples,
8: and faded blues of night was its only blanket.
