Activity 1: 

Questions
1. How many bits does it take to represent the values from 0 to 255?  
One byte is 8 bits and a maximum of 8 bits is needed to store the numbers from 0 to 255 since
11111111 (base 2 number) represents 1 + 2 + 4 + 8 + 16 + 32 + 64 + 128 = 255. Since there are 3 values, one
for R, another for G and another for B, then (8)(3) = 24 bits are needed to store the values from 0 to 255. 

2. How many bytes does it take to represent a color in the RBG color model? 
Since 1 byte = 8 bits, there are 24/8 = 3 bytes needed to store a color in the RBG model, 
following the reasoning from the answer to question 1. 

3. How many pixels are in a picture that is 640 pixels wide and 480 pixels high? 
There are (640)(480) = 307,200 pixels in the picture.
